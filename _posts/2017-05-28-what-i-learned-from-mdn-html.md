I never seriously studied HTML, just thought it was too much easy to devote a lot
of time to it. You can just find out info as you code. But no, when you're doing
your job, you're usually under time pressure, so you'll only find that which
prevents you from delivering your code and passing code review, not everything
important.

There are some surprising facts about HTML I found on [MDN][mdn-link]{:target="_blank"}:

1. Element which consist only of single tag is called *empty element* or
*void element*, eg. `<img>` element.
2. You can use `'` instead of `"` in HTML templates. I won't, because nobody does, but it's nice to
know.
3. You can add `lang` attribute to any element eg. `<span lang="en"></span>`
